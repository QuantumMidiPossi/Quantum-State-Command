## 🧬 Overview

**Quantum State Command Encoding (QSCE)** is a deterministic multi-pathway quantum command architecture validated at TRL-7 on IBM’s superconducting hardware. This whitepaper introduces the **QSTS-DQA orchestration framework** and four activation pathways:

- 🔹 QMCA – Quantum Measurement Collapse Activation  
- 🔹 SQCA – Superconducting Quantum Circuit Activation  
- 🔹 EBA – Entanglement-Based Activation  
- 🔹 QPSA – Quantum Photonic Switching Activation  

Each enables native command encoding using Bloch sphere logic and achieves real hardware determinism — a leap toward secure quantum control, fusion containment, and beyond.

## 📊 Validation & Results

- ✅ **TRL-7** confirmation on IBM_Kyiv backend  
- ✅ Deterministic outcomes: 980x |00⟩ under EBA pathway  
- ✅ Noise simulation validated QPSA for plasma containment

## 💡 Why It Matters

This architecture addresses foundational challenges in:
- Quantum command determinism  
- Activation-based quantum logic  
- Real-world deployability at scale  
- Nuclear fusion stability via QPSA-II

### 🛰️ For Principal Engineers & Systems Leads

Quantum State Command Encoding (QSCE) is a TRL-7 validated quantum-native control architecture demonstrated on IBM superconducting hardware (ibm_kyiv). It enables deterministic activation logic with ultra-low qubit footprint (1–2 qubits) and is protected under a U.S. non-provisional patent (filed April 2025).

This repository provides a sandbox demo of phase-state command mapping and activation pathways across four deterministic logic models (QMCA, SQCA, EBA, QPSA). Validation results include hardware runs and histogram outputs.

🛡️ *Note: Hamiltonians, unitary matrices, and evolution logic are IP-protected and available under NDA for qualified engineering leads.*

📩 Licensing and collaboration inquiries welcome.
